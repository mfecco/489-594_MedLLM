Here's a summary of the discharge information, focusing on the requested aspects:

**Injuries:**

*   **Left Groin Wound Infection:**  The patient presented with a left groin wound infection, exposing the left axillobifemoral graft. The infection was caused by Gram-negative *Pseudomonas* bacteremia, originating from the graft site. The infected portion of the graft was surgically removed.
*   **Severe Peripheral Vascular Disease:** Underlying condition contributing to the graft occlusion and infection.
*   **Right Groin Fluid Collection:** A fluid collection was observed in the right groin, surrounding the femoral portion of the graft. Aspiration suggested a seroma rather than infection, although the CT scan also mentions a possible thrombus.
*   **Cardiac Issues:**  History of CAD, MI, CABG, CHF.  The PERSANTINE MIBI results suggest severe, fixed defects in multiple areas of the heart, with an ejection fraction of 17%. The TEE results suggest severely depressed overall left ventricular systolic function with akinesis of the mid to distal septal wall and severe hypokinesis of mid to distal inferolateral walls.

**Treatment Plan:**

*   **Medications at Discharge:**
    *   Coumadin (dosage and frequency not specified) - for graft maintenance.
    *   Vancomycin (oral, dosage and frequency not specified) - to be continued for 2 additional weeks after Meropenem discontinuation
    *   Meropenem (IV via tunneled catheter, dosage and frequency not specified) - to be continued for a total of 12 weeks.
    *   Tobramycin (IV via tunneled catheter, dosage and frequency not specified) - to be continued for 2 weeks.

*   **Procedures:**
    *   **Surgical Graft Revision:** Excision of the distal portion of the left axillobifemoral graft and replacement with interposition left axillary profunda bypass and left axillary to mid cross-femoral bypass with 8-mm PTFE.
    *   **Left Groin Wound Debridement and Closure:** The infected left groin wound was debrided and closed.
    *   **Tunneled Catheter Placement:** Placed for long-term IV antibiotic administration. Scheduled for removal.
    *   **Wound Care:** Keep the wound dry. Sutures to be removed in 4 weeks at surgeon's follow-up appointment. Avoid tub baths, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub. Limit strenuous activity and heavy lifting. Keep affected limb elevated.
    *   **Diagnostic Aspiration:** Ultrasound-guided aspiration of fluid in the right groin.

*   **Physical Therapy/Rehabilitation:**
    *   The patient is being discharged to a rehab facility, implying a plan for physical and occupational therapy to regain strength and mobility. Specific exercises or frequency are not detailed.

*   **Follow-up:**
    *   Follow-up appointment with Dr. scheduled for two weeks from discharge, at 11:00.

### Injuries ###

*   **Aortic Dissection of Descending Aorta:** This was the primary reason for admission, specifically an increase in the size of the false lumen at the level of the aortic arch and azygos arch (measuring 5.2 cm compared to a prior 3.8 cm). The dissection extended from the superior aspect of the graft through the left iliac artery, and there was a dissection in the right innominate artery with thrombus extension into the false lumen. This was a recurrent issue following a previous aortic dissection repair and pericardial aortic valve replacement.

*   **Purpura over the Ankles Bilaterally:** New onset purpura (skin lesions) over both ankles, associated with pain, developed post-operatively. This was initially suspected to be Coumadin-induced skin necrosis, HIT, low-grade DIC, or cholesterol emboli. Ultimately attributed to Low Grade DIC.

### Injuries

*   **Original Injury:** Unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma causing duodenal stricture, previously treated with palliative duodenal stenting.
*   **Hematemesis:** Cause initially thought to be malfunction of the duodenal stent (obstruction, erosion into duodenal mucosa), but ERCP revealed food impaction. Later, feculent vomiting suggested small bowel obstruction.
*   **Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO):** Distal to the duodenal stent, confirmed by CT scan. Likely related to adhesions from previous surgeries.
*   **Liver Laceration:** Occurred during the initial exploratory laparotomy and adhesiolysis. Resulted in a biliary ductal leak, requiring a second surgery for repair.
*   **Wound Breakdown:** Midline incision (laparotomy) showed evidence of breakdown with staples pulling apart, but without signs of infection, though some serosanguinous drainage was present.
*   **Anemia:** Due to acute blood loss, likely related to the initial GI bleed/hematemesis.
*   **Pleural Effusions:** New, small bilateral pleural effusions observed on CT scan.

### Treatment Plan

*   **Medications:**
    *   Patient expired; therefore, there were no discharge medications prescribed.

    *   **Palliative duodenal stenting:** Performed prior to admission for duodenal stricture caused by pancreatic cancer.
    *   **NG tube to suction:** Initially for hematemesis, later for SBO and feculent vomiting. Removed when output minimal and bowel function returning.
    *   **ERCP:** To evaluate duodenal stent malfunction; revealed food impaction.
    *   **Exploratory Laparotomy:** For SBO.
    *   **Adhesiolysis:** Extensive lysis of adhesions during the laparotomy.
    *   **Small Bowel Resection:** In the ileum, performed during laparotomy for SBO.
    *   **Enterotomy:** For decompression of the small bowel.
    *   **Repair of Biliary Ductal Leak:** Reopening of recent laparotomy to repair biliary ductal leak from liver laceration.
    *   **Blood Transfusion:** One unit of PRBC given for anemia.
    *   **Wound Care:** Dressing changes with dry gauze due to wound breakdown of the midline incision. Wound care consulted.

*   **Physical Therapy/Rehabilitation:**
    *   Patient was ambulating and out of bed to the chair.

Areas identified in the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally, greater on the left than right, in the globus pallidus bilaterally, and in the right frontal subcortical and periventricular white matter. Also identified on the MR, but not on the CT scan, is a region of hyperintensity in the mid-brain on the left, as well as several smaller white matter lesions bilaterally in the frontal white matter. These are consistent with watershed infarctions due to hypotension and hypoperfusion.
