These assessments are crucial in pre- and post-intervention evaluations.
NEW SECTION: SPINAL CORD INJURY

Acute Management Procedures:

Emergency personnel must immobilize suspected spinal cord injuries using a hard cervical collar and a hard backboard.

Spinal immobilization should be continued until definitive treatment is performed.

Assess airway, breathing, and circulation immediately.

If intubation is needed due to respiratory issues or injury level, use the jaw-thrust maneuver to avoid spinal damage.

The exam identifies sensory and motor function, helps in prognostication, and guides further treatment​
.

NEW SECTION: TBI – Neuroimaging Procedure

Indication: Neuroimaging is required in all moderate to severe TBI cases and many mild TBIs.

Casting, Orthotics, and Assistive Devices

Serial Casting
Applied for flexible joint contractures using soft or reinforced casts, worn for 1–4 weeks and changed every 7–10 days.

NEW SECTION: Vascular_Diseases – PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE (DIAGNOSTIC & REHAB PROCEDURES)

Ankle–Brachial Index (ABI):

Measure dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pressures and divide by higher arm pressure.

ABI < 0.9 indicates PAD; ABI > 1.4 may suggest arterial calcification.

Other Tests:

Toe–brachial index for noncompressible arteries.

Duplex ultrasound, transcutaneous oximetry, MRA, and CTA for further evaluation.

Angiography is the gold standard (reserved for revascularization planning).

Exercise Therapy Protocol:

Treadmill walking 3 days/week, 30–60 minutes.

Walk until moderate claudication, rest, then resume.

Increase grade/speed as tolerated over 24 weeks.

Arm ergometer for those unable to walk.

Pharmacologic Therapy:

Cilostazol (phosphodiesterase III inhibitor) for vasodilation and platelet aggregation.

Naftidrofuryl and possibly L-carnitine to improve walking distance and quality of life.

NEW SECTION: KINESIOLOGY – ASSESSING PLANTAR FLEXOR WEAKNESS

Clinical Procedure: Manual resistance applied by an examiner is not sufficient to detect weakness in the ankle plantar flexors due to the mechanical advantage of the type 2 lever system.

Recommended Test: Use a heel raise exercise for assessment—this mimics physiological demands and exposes true weakness more reliably than manual testing.

NEW SECTION: KINESIOLOGY – FUNCTIONAL SUBSTITUTION IN TETRAPLEGIA

Clinical Application: In C6 tetraplegia (where triceps are not innervated), elbow extension can still occur via muscle substitution in a closed chain.

Planes of Compensation:

Sagittal plane: Anterior deltoid and serratus anterior draw the proximal humerus forward.

Transverse plane: Pectoralis major contracts to adduct the humerus.

Coronal plane: Latissimus dorsi adducts the humerus.

Outcome: Elbow extension occurs through proximal humeral movement with the hand fixed (e.g., during wheelchair propulsion or transfers).

NEW SECTION: KINESIOLOGY – LOSS OF OVERHEAD MOTION & SERRATUS ANTERIOR WEAKNESS

Clinical Correlation: Pseudo-weakness in the upper limb may be caused by serratus anterior dysfunction (e.g., long thoracic nerve palsy), which destabilizes the scapula.

Procedure: During manual muscle testing of the upper limb, apparent weakness might be observed, not due to true muscle pathology, but due to impaired scapular positioning.

Evaluation Tip: Always assess the thoracoscapular muscles when diagnosing unexplained weakness in shoulder or elbow function.
NEW SECTION: IMMOBILITY – MUSCULOSKELETAL CONSEQUENCES (PREVENTION & TREATMENT)

NEW SECTION: IMMOBILITY – VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM (TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT)

Diagnosis:

d-dimer testing

Compression ultrasound

Medical Management:

Start anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin with bridging via heparin/enoxaparin)

Continue bridging until INR > 2.0 for 24+ hours

Monitor CBC, platelets, renal/liver function depending on drug

Mobilization:

Encourage early ambulation

Use compression stockings if ambulation is not possible

Special Populations:

Neurosurgical patients: Prefer mechanical prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression); pharmacologic options introduced based on surgeon guidance

Orthopedic patients: LMWH preferred for at least 10–14 days post-op, ideally up to 35 days; use portable compression if anticoagulants are contraindicated
